        <h3 class="mb-3">Short History</h3>

        <p>On November 13th, 1978, the Boca Secondary School opened its doors; it was then called Boca Junior Secondary School. The uniform was khaki pants and white shirts for boys and khaki skirts and white shirts for girls. It was managed by the Ministry of Education. Mr. Orleans John became the first Principal in 1979.</p>

        <p>In September 1983, the compound accommodated two (2) schools: the Secondary School and the Junior Secondary, which began its phasing out process. Mr. Spencer Edwards was the Principal of the Junior Secondary, and Mr. Michael Anderson was the first Principal of the Secondary School. After the military invasion, Mr. Anderson left, and Mr. Spencer Edwards assumed responsibility as principal of both schools.</p>

        <p>Many other principals or acting principals have left their indelible mark â€” for example: Mr. Leonard Greaux, the late Mr. Victor Antoine, Mrs. Pauline St. Paul, and Mr. Martin Mitchell. The school had a curriculum of thirty-two (32) subjects, many of which were technical/vocational subjects including Family and Resource Management, Clothing, Textiles & Fashion, Building Furniture Technology, Auto Mechanics, and Electronics and Electrical Technology.</p>
